# Getting Started

To begin, it is recommended to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies:
`poetry shell`

You can then install the dependencies that will allow you to run tests:
`poetry install`

This will install `homeassistant`, `pytest`, and `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`, a plugin which allows you to leverage helpers that are available in Home Assistant for core integration tests.

# Useful commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
`pytest tests/` | This will run all tests in `tests/` and tell you how many passed/failed
`pytest --durations=10 --cov-report term-missing --cov=custom_components.schedule_state tests` | This tells `pytest` that your target module to test is `custom_components.schedule_state` so that it can give you a [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) summary, including % of code that was executed and the line numbers of missed executions.
`pytest tests/test_init.py -k test_setup_unload_and_reload_entry` | Runs the `test_setup_unload_and_reload_entry` test function located in `tests/test_init.py`
